# COVID-19 (Coronavirus) spread simulator ü¶†

Check simulations about how confinement people could help to stop spreading Coronavirus.

[Based on Washington Post Article: Why outbreaks like coronavirus spread exponentially, and how to ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù - Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/)

## How to start

Install all the project dependencies with:
```
npm install
```

And start the development server with:
```
npm run dev
```

## Browser support

This project is using EcmaScript Modules, therefore, only browsers with this compatibility will work. (Sorry Internet Explorer 11 and old Edge users).

## gioid's enhancements

I forked the midudev's repo and applied the following changes:

- percentage of people with contact-tracing app, that notify infected matches and suggest auto-isolation
- failure rate of contact-tracing app, so the app cannot notify an infected match due to physical/software issues
- percentage of conformists, because a person notified of the infected match can choose to avoid auto-isolation

You can see the result in action at the following link (thank you GitHub Pages):
